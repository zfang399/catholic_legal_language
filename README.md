# nltk_catholic_legal_language_project
Cooperated with the Department of Computer Science and the Center for Civil and Human Rights at the University of Notre Dame.
Worked on the correlation between legal documents (law,constitution,etc.) and Catholic documents (books about Catholism). Used the nltk package in python. Found correlations between certain fields of law and religion.
